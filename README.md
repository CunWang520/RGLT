# RGLT
GLT has presented the first attempt to accelerate GNN inference. Though promising, GLT encounters robustness and generalization issues when deployed in real-world scenarios. To tackle these issues, we propose the Resilient Graph Lottery Ticket (RGLT) to find more robust and generalizable GLT in GNNs.
